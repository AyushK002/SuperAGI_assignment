Custom GPT-2 Model Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the GPT-2 model with enhancements including Rotary Positional Embedding, Group Query Attention, and Sliding Window Attention. These enhancements aim to improve the model's efficiency and understanding of sequential data.

Features


Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE): Implements rotary embeddings to encode sequence position information, enhancing the model's comprehension of relative positions in sequences.

Group Query Attention: Modifies the standard attention mechanism by grouping queries, aiming to reduce computational complexity and enhance the model's focus.

Sliding Window Attention: Restricts attention to a fixed-size window, enabling the model to focus more on local context and potentially improve performance, especially for longer sequences.

Components


GPT2Embeddings: Modified to include Rotary Positional Embedding.

ScaledDotProductAttention: Base class for implementing attention mechanisms.

GroupQueryAttention: Derived from ScaledDotProductAttention, implements the Group Query Attention mechanism.

SlidingWindowAttention: Also derived from ScaledDotProductAttention, this class implements the Sliding Window Attention mechanism.

MultiHeadAttention: Integrates the chosen attention mechanism (Group Query or Sliding Window Attention).

TransformerBlock: A standard transformer block incorporating the custom multi-head attention.

GPT2: The full GPT-2 model structure, integrating the above components.

Usage
To use this custom GPT-2 model, follow these steps:

Model Initialization: Instantiate the GPT-2 model with desired parameters.

python

model = GPT2(vocab_size, max_seq_len, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_hidden_dim, num_layers)

Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset and tokenize it using the appropriate tokenizer.

Training: Train the model using a suitable training loop. For distributed training, adaptations using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) or Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) are recommended.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model on your specific tasks to observe the impacts of the implemented enhancements.

Dependencies

PyTorch
Transformers (Hugging Face)
Notes
The effectiveness of the enhancements may vary based on the specific task and dataset.
Careful tuning and evaluation are recommended to fully leverage the benefits of the enhancements.
